## 1. Project Overview & Goals

2. **Exploration:** User navigates to view services, case studies, and blog articles relevant to NRI legal issues.
3. **Scheduling:** User accesses the booking system, selects their own time zone, and sees available slots in their local time.
4. **Booking:** User selects a consultation type (30-min audio call or document review), fills out a brief intake form, and proceeds to payment.
5. **Confirmation:** After successful payment, the user receives an automated confirmation email with the appointment details, a WhatsApp contact for the audio call, and instructions for secure document submission.

## 6. Development Workflow & Standards

- **AI Interaction:** When generating code, always refer to this document for context. Prefix prompts with the relevant section number.
- **Changelog:** All significant AI-generated changes must be logged in `changelog.md`.
- **Code Quality:**
  - Code must be clean, well-commented, and self-documenting where possible.
  - Strictly follow TypeScript types. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary and justified.
  - All environment variables must be managed in a `.env.local` file and documented in `.env.example`.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling on both the client and server sides. API responses should use standard HTTP status codes.

## 7. File & Component Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (`BookingCalendar.tsx`, `PrimaryButton.tsx`). Place in `/components/ui` for general UI elements and `/components/sections` for larger page sections.
- **Pages/Routes:** kebab-case for file-based routing (`/booking`, `/case-studies`). Next.js App Router convention (`/app/booking/page.tsx`).
- **API Routes:** kebab-case (`/api/create-booking.ts`).
- **Hooks:** Use `use` prefix (`useAvailability.ts`).
- **Types:** Place custom types in a `/types/index.ts` file or co-locate with the component if specific. Name with PascalCase (e.g., `BookingData`).

## 8. Coding Standards

- **Language:** Always use TypeScript. Provide types for all function parameters and return values.
- **File Naming:**
  - Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `BookingForm.tsx`).
  - API Routes: Use folder-based routing, e.g., `app/api/booking/route.ts`.
- **Component Structure:**
  - Use functional components with React Hooks.
  - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
  - Use Server Components by default. Only add the `"use client";` directive when client-side interactivity is necessary.
- **Theming:**
  - Colors: Use theme colors defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. Example: `bg-brand-primary`, `text-accent`. Do not use arbitrary values like `bg-[#1B4F72]`.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap async operations in try/catch blocks. Return structured JSON responses from API routes: `{ success: boolean, data: any }` or `{ success: false, error: string }`.
- **Comments:** Add JSDoc comments to complex functions, utility functions, and API endpoints.
